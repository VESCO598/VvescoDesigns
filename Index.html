I was born on the 23rd August 1998, and was born in Toronto Ontario Which is loacted in North-America. I am a Grapchic Designer, Programmer, Photographer, and a YouTuber.

Some include QuaterbackHq, Tech-Ena, and Harpers.  
</p>
      <h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p> I've created this website so that people can acess my services the easiest way for YouTubers and Companies. I plann on branching out on to different aeras of designing so people can find multiple services in one aera. But the companies main goal is to help people that need these services and can afford it at an affordable price which satisfies the customer and our company. If our prices seem too high for people we  will be hosting seasonial giveaways, Promotions, and other thing which will be announced over all of our social media platforms. If it's still too high, we will send you to other designers that work alongside this company and try and suit your needs.   </p>

      </p>
      <h2>When did I start; Programming Designing Photography and YouTube ?</h2> 
      <p>
    For<Strong> Graphic Designing</Strong> I am a self-taught designer who started out whith nothing and wanted to keep grinding. I got into it when I had to make a YouTube banner for my channel and watched a bunch of tutorials for GrapchiDesigning I got so into it i choes to make them myself.
    <Strong>YouTube</Strong> was mainly for my portfolio, but It got to a point where i want to do tutorials to help less experienced designgers since I understand their struggel, and i've always wanted to do one.   
      <Strong>Programming</Strong> was a funny one since I was forced to take it in my first school called St.Anthonys Secondary. At first I hated it becuase i was forced to do it. but when we where learning web-develoupment (Html only) I liked it since it was stupid simple and fun. When leaving that school i ignored it for about 5-years. Fast foward to now I had to reteach myself code in order to creat my website and when I was re-teaching myself code I started to love again.
      </p>
      <h2> Why do I do this for a living?</h2>
<p>I have multiple reasons to why i do this for a living by i'm going to tell you the main reasons. Firstly I've never liked working a 9-5 shift since i was forced to not be myslef and follow a bunch of rules and regulations, my other reason is lack of authority, I've never liked being told what to do and if people know they're higher than you they'll bully you to make sure their in power. Lastly i like doin'g whatever I want whenever I want and i've realised if i want to live a lifestyle like that i have to be a freelancer or become my own boss. It may sound a bit overkill but thoes are the main reasons to why i started the company.  </p>
